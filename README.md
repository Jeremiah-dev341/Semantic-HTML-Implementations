# Semantic HTML Examples

This repository provides practical examples of semantic HTML usage, supporting the blog on *Mastering Semantic HTML*.  

## What’s inside
- **semantic-example.html** → Demonstrates proper semantic structure.
- **non-semantic-example.html** → Shows a page built only with `<div>` and `<span>` (bad practice).
- **before-semantic.html** → Non-semantic version of a blog layout (with explanatory comments).
- **after-semantic.html** → Semantic version of the same blog layout (with explanatory comments).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Open the `.html` files in your browser to see the structure.
3. Compare `before-semantic.html` and `after-semantic.html` to understand the improvements semantic HTML provides.

## Why Semantic HTML?
- Improves accessibility (screen readers understand your content).
- Helps SEO (search engines know the meaning of your content).
- Makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
